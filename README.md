####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

These are some things that I tried to improve speed in **index.html**:

1. Minify and inline CSS files **print.css**, **style.css** using some web base tools like listed bellow:

    * [CSS Minifier](https://cssminifier.com/)
    * [Clean CSS](http://www.cleancss.com/css-minify/)
    * [CSS Compressor](http://csscompressor.com/)
    
      Saving about 338 ms

2. Minify JS and inline files **perfmatters.js** using web tools like these:

3. Copy analytics.js file from (google analytics)[http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js] and Minify as well inlining
